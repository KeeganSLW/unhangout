## v2.1.0

 - Upgrade to selenium-server-standalone v2.53.0 and selenium-webdriver v2.47.0.  You will likely need to re-download selenium-server-standalone:

         curl -L https://selenium-release.storage.googleapis.com/2.53/selenium-server-standalone-2.53.0.jar > bin/selenium-server-standalone.jar

 - Tear out old farming functionality, which Google broke. See [hangout-farmer](https://github.com/unhangout/hangout-farmer.git) for a temporary workaround until we can replace Google Hangouts.

## v2.0.0

 - First version of changelog.
